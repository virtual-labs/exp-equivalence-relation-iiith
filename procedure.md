### Procedure

##### Interactive Necklace Equivalence Exploration:

**Setup and Configuration:**
- Open the simulation interface which displays an interactive necklace with colored beads arranged in a circle.
- Configure experiment parameters using the settings panel:
  - Adjust the number of beads (6-12 beads) using the bead count slider
  - Modify the number of colors (2-8 colors) using the color count slider
  - Choose difficulty mode: Easy (direct colors) or Hard (color mapping challenge)

**Understanding Necklace Equivalence:**
- Two necklaces are considered equivalent if one can be transformed into the other through:
  - **Rotations**: Moving beads cyclically around the circle (any number of positions)
  - **Reflections**: Creating a mirror image of the necklace pattern
  - **Combinations**: Applying both rotations and reflections in sequence
- The necklace pattern is represented as a string showing the sequence of colored beads
- Position numbers on beads help track transformations and understand the equivalence concept

**Interactive Exploration:**
1. **Practice Mode**: 
   - Use the "Rotate →" button to rotate the necklace one position clockwise
   - Use the "Reflect ↔" button to create a mirror image of the current pattern
   - Observe how the string representation changes with each transformation
   - Monitor the transformation log to track your operations

2. **Challenge Mode**:
   - Click "New Challenge" to generate two necklaces (Target and Current)
   - Analyze both patterns carefully, considering possible rotations and reflections
   - Determine if the necklaces are equivalent using your understanding of transformations
   - Answer "Yes, Equivalent" or "No, Not Equivalent" based on your analysis
   - Receive immediate feedback with explanations

**Learning Progression:**
- Start with Easy mode to focus on equivalence concepts without color confusion
- Progress to Hard mode where colors are mapped differently, requiring deeper analysis
- Use the color mapping guide in Hard mode to decode the actual colors
- Challenge yourself with different bead counts and color combinations
- Track your understanding through the scoring system and accuracy feedback

**Mathematical Concepts Reinforced:**
- Equivalence relation properties: reflexive, symmetric, and transitive
- Group theory applications through dihedral group transformations
- Burnside's lemma for counting distinct equivalence classes
- Pattern recognition and systematic analysis of mathematical structures
