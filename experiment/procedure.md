### Procedure

##### Necklace Problem:
- It has a fixed length n and beads of different colors.
- We consider rotations of the necklace to be equivalent. In other words, the order of the beads matters, but not their starting position.
- Necklace problem defines an equivalence relation on strings of length n over an alphabet of size k. 
- Two strings are considered equivalent if one can be obtained by rotating or reflecting the other.
- When two necklaces are equivalent their string representations matches.
- This rotation can happen any number of times.
