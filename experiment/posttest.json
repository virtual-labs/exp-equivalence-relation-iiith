        "a": "${n,1}$",

        "c": "${n^2,1}$",
        "d": "${1,n^2}$"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect! For a set with n elements, the number of possible ordered pairs is n², not n. For example, with A = {1,2}, possible pairs are (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), giving 4 = 2² elements.",
        "b": "Incorrect! While n is the size of the set, the largest equivalence relation contains all possible pairs (n²), and its rank (number of equivalence classes) would be 1, not n. For example, with A = {1,2}, the universal relation has 4 pairs but only 1 class.",
        "c": "Correct! For a set with n elements, the largest equivalence relation is the universal relation containing all n² possible pairs, and it has rank 1 (all elements in one class). For example, with A = {1,2,3}, we have 9 pairs and all elements are equivalent.",
        "d": "Incorrect! The order is reversed. The number of elements is n² (all possible pairs), and the rank is 1 (one equivalence class containing all elements), not the other way around."

        "d": "$72$"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect! 125 is far too large. For a set with 3 elements, the total number of possible relations is 2⁹ (as there are 9 possible pairs), and only some of these are equivalence relations.",
        "b": "Correct! For set B = {2,4,5}, the possible partitions are: {{2,4,5}}, {{2},{4,5}}, {{4},{2,5}}, {{5},{2,4}}, {{2},{4},{5}}. Each partition corresponds to exactly one equivalence relation, so there are 5 possible equivalence relations.",
        "c": "Incorrect! 16 is not the correct count. While 2⁴ = 16 represents some binary choice, it's not related to the number of possible equivalence relations on this 3-element set.",
        "d": "Incorrect! 72 is too large. The number of equivalence relations on a 3-element set must be less than the total number of possible relations (2⁹ = 512)."

        "d": "symmetric relation"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect! While the relation is not irreflexive (as most numbers divide themselves), the main issue is that it's not symmetric. For example, 2|4 but 4∤2.",
        "b": "Correct! The division relation fails both reflexivity and symmetry: 1) Not reflexive because 0∤0 (0 doesn't divide 0). 2) Not symmetric because if a|b, b|a may not hold (e.g., 2|4 but 4∤2).",
        "c": "Incorrect! The division relation is actually transitive. If a|b and b|c, then a|c. For example, if 2|4 and 4|8, then 2|8.",
        "d": "Incorrect! While the relation is indeed not symmetric, it also fails reflexivity. The question asks for all properties that fail."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect! These subsets don't form a partition because: 1) Elements 3, 5, and 6 appear in multiple sets (not disjoint). 2) The union doesn't cover all elements of the original set.",
        "b": "Correct! This is a valid partition because: 1) All subsets are disjoint (no element appears twice). 2) The union covers the entire set {3,4,5,6,7}. 3) No subset is empty.",
        "c": "Incorrect! This is not a partition because: 1) Element 5 is missing (union doesn't equal the original set). 2) Even though the sets are disjoint, they don't include all elements.",
        "d": "Incorrect! This fails to be a partition because: 1) Element 5 appears in both sets (not disjoint). 2) Elements 3 and 4 are missing (incomplete coverage)."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! In modulo 7, numbers that differ by multiples of 7 form equivalence classes. Since 45 ≡ 3 (mod 7), we're looking for the class containing 0. This is {... -14, -7, 0, 7, 14, ...} = {..., 0, 7, 14, 28, ...}.",
        "b": "Incorrect! This sequence doesn't represent a valid equivalence class modulo 7 as the differences between consecutive terms aren't multiples of 7.",
        "c": "Incorrect! This sequence represents numbers that differ by 4, not by 7 which is required for congruence modulo 7.",
        "d": "Incorrect! While this includes some numbers congruent modulo 7, it's not the correct equivalence class for 45 ≡ 3 (mod 7)."

        "a": "Incorrect! Two different equivalence classes must be disjoint. For example, in modulo 2 arithmetic, [0] = {0,2,4,...} and [1] = {1,3,5,...} have empty intersection.",
        "b": "Incorrect! The union of two equivalence classes is generally not an equivalence class. For example, in 'same parity' relation, [2]∪[3] = {even numbers}∪{odd numbers} = ℤ is not an equivalence class.",
        "c": "Correct! This is a fundamental property of equivalence relations: equivalence classes either coincide completely or are disjoint. For example, in modulo 3, either [1]=[4] (as 1≡4 mod 3) or [1]∩[2]=∅ (as 1≢2 mod 3).",
        "d": "Incorrect! Equivalence classes can have different sizes. For example, in the relation 'has same absolute value' on integers, [0] = {0} has size 1, while [1] = {1,-1} has size 2."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! R×S is always an equivalence relation on X×Y. Let's verify: 1) Reflexive: ((x₁,y₁),(x₁,y₁)) ∈ R×S as (x₁,x₁) ∈ R and (y₁,y₁) ∈ S. 2) Symmetric: If ((x₁,y₁),(x₂,y₂)) ∈ R×S, then (x₂,x₁) ∈ R and (y₂,y₁) ∈ S, so ((x₂,y₂),(x₁,y₁)) ∈ R×S. 3) Transitive: Similar chain argument works.",
        "b": "Incorrect! The Cartesian product of equivalence relations preserves all three properties (reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity). For example, if R is 'same parity' and S is 'same sign', R×S relates pairs with both same parity and same sign.",
        "c": "Incorrect! R×S is an equivalence relation even when X≠Y. For example, R could be 'same parity' on integers and S could be 'same sign' on reals.",

        "a": "Incorrect! With n equivalence classes, we need at least n reflexive pairs (one for each class), but this isn't enough as we also need symmetric and transitive pairs.",
        "b": "Incorrect! 2n pairs would not be enough to ensure transitivity within each equivalence class, especially for classes with more than 2 elements.",
        "c": "Incorrect! n² would be too many pairs for the minimum case. Consider when each equivalence class contains exactly one element - we only need n reflexive pairs.",
        "d": "Correct! The minimum occurs when each equivalence class contains exactly one element except possibly one class with two elements (if n doesn't divide |A|). Each element needs a reflexive pair, and elements in the same class need symmetric and transitive pairs. For example, with n=3 classes {{1},{2},{3}}, we need exactly 3 pairs (1,1),(2,2),(3,3)."

        "b": "Correct! With one class of 4 elements and |A| = 10, the remaining 6 elements must be distributed among 3 classes. The maximum size possible for the second largest class is 3, as in distribution {4,3,2,1} which sums to 10.",
        "c": "Incorrect! We can achieve a larger second class. Consider distribution {4,3,2,1} which satisfies all conditions with second class having 3 elements.",

        "c": "Incorrect! While there are 365 regular days, we must account for leap years (February 29), making 366 the upper bound.",
        "d": "Correct! Since R groups people by birth month and day: 1) Each person belongs to exactly one class (their birthday). 2) The maximum number of possible birthdays is 366 (including Feb 29). 3) Some classes might be empty if no one has that birthday."
