        "d": "$ {1,n^2} $"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect! For a set with n elements, the number of possible ordered pairs is n², not n. For example, with A = {1,2}, possible pairs are (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), giving 4 = 2² elements.",
        "b": "Incorrect! While n is the size of the set, the largest equivalence relation contains all possible pairs (n²), and its rank (number of equivalence classes) would be 1, not n. For example, with A = {1,2}, the universal relation has 4 pairs but only 1 class.",
        "c": "Correct! For a set with n elements, the largest equivalence relation is the universal relation containing all n² possible pairs, and it has rank 1 (all elements in one class). For example, with A = {1,2,3}, we have 9 pairs and all elements are equivalent.",
        "d": "Incorrect! The order is reversed. The number of elements is n² (all possible pairs), and the rank is 1 (one equivalence class containing all elements), not the other way around."

        "d": "$ 72 $"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect! 125 is far too large. For a set with 3 elements, the total number of possible relations is 2⁹ (as there are 9 possible pairs), and only some of these are equivalence relations.",
        "b": "Correct! For set B = {2,4,5}, the possible partitions are: {{2,4,5}}, {{2},{4,5}}, {{4},{2,5}}, {{5},{2,4}}, {{2},{4},{5}}. Each partition corresponds to exactly one equivalence relation, so there are 5 possible equivalence relations.",
        "c": "Incorrect! 16 is not the correct count. While 2⁴ = 16 represents some binary choice, it's not related to the number of possible equivalence relations on this 3-element set.",
        "d": "Incorrect! 72 is too large. The number of equivalence relations on a 3-element set must be less than the total number of possible relations (2⁹ = 512)."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect! While the relation is not irreflexive (as most numbers divide themselves), the main issue is that it's not symmetric. For example, 2|4 but 4∤2.",
        "b": "Correct! The division relation fails both reflexivity and symmetry: 1) Not reflexive because 0∤0 (0 doesn't divide 0). 2) Not symmetric because if a|b, b|a may not hold (e.g., 2|4 but 4∤2).",
        "c": "Incorrect! The division relation is actually transitive. If a|b and b|c, then a|c. For example, if 2|4 and 4|8, then 2|8.",
        "d": "Incorrect! While the relation is indeed not symmetric, it also fails reflexivity. The question asks for all properties that fail."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect! These subsets don't form a partition because: 1) Elements 3, 5, and 6 appear in multiple sets (not disjoint). 2) The union doesn't cover all elements of the original set.",
        "b": "Correct! This is a valid partition because: 1) All subsets are disjoint (no element appears twice). 2) The union covers the entire set {3,4,5,6,7}. 3) No subset is empty.",
        "c": "Incorrect! This is not a partition because: 1) Element 5 is missing (union doesn't equal the original set). 2) Even though the sets are disjoint, they don't include all elements.",
        "d": "Incorrect! This fails to be a partition because: 1) Element 5 appears in both sets (not disjoint). 2) Elements 3 and 4 are missing (incomplete coverage)."

        "a": "Incorrect! This is the equivalence class of 0 modulo 7, not the class containing 45.",
        "b": "Incorrect! This sequence doesn't represent a valid equivalence class modulo 7 as elements don't differ by multiples of 7.",
        "c": "Correct! Since 45 ≡ 3 (mod 7), both 45 and 3 belong to the same equivalence class. The class is {... -11, -4, 3, 10, 17, 24, 31, ...}, which consists of all integers that leave remainder 3 when divided by 7. We can verify: 45 = 6×7 + 3, so 45 ≡ 3 (mod 7).",
        "d": "Incorrect! While this includes 3, the pattern breaks as 8 - 3 = 5 (not 7), 15 - 8 = 7 (correct), but then 21 - 15 = 6 (not 7), so this is not a valid equivalence class."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect! Two different equivalence classes must be disjoint. For example, in modulo 2 arithmetic, [0] = {0,2,4,...} and [1] = {1,3,5,...} have empty intersection.",
        "b": "Incorrect! The union of two equivalence classes is generally not an equivalence class. For example, in 'same parity' relation, [2]∪[3] = {even numbers}∪{odd numbers} = ℤ is not an equivalence class.",
        "c": "Correct! This is a fundamental property of equivalence relations: equivalence classes either coincide completely or are disjoint. For example, in modulo 3, either [1]=[4] (as 1≡4 mod 3) or [1]∩[2]=∅ (as 1≢2 mod 3).",
        "d": "Incorrect! Equivalence classes can have different sizes. For example, in the relation 'has same absolute value' on integers, [0] = {0} has size 1, while [1] = {1,-1} has size 2."

        "a": "Correct! R×S is always an equivalence relation on X×Y. Let's verify: 1) Reflexive: ((x₁,y₁),(x₁,y₁)) ∈ R×S as (x₁,x₁) ∈ R and (y₁,y₁) ∈ S. 2) Symmetric: If ((x₁,y₁),(x₂,y₂)) ∈ R×S, then (x₂,x₁) ∈ R and (y₂,y₁) ∈ S, so ((x₂,y₂),(x₁,y₁)) ∈ R×S. 3) Transitive: Similar chain argument works.",
        "b": "Incorrect! The Cartesian product of equivalence relations preserves all three properties (reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity). For example, if R is 'same parity' and S is 'same sign', R×S relates pairs with both same parity and same sign.",
        "c": "Incorrect! R×S is an equivalence relation even when X≠Y. For example, R could be 'same parity' on integers and S could be 'same sign' on reals.",

        "a": "Correct! The minimum occurs when each equivalence class contains exactly one element. In this case, the equivalence relation consists only of the reflexive pairs: (1,1), (2,2), ..., (n,n), giving exactly n ordered pairs. This satisfies reflexivity (each element relates to itself), symmetry (reflexive pairs are trivially symmetric), and transitivity (only reflexive pairs exist, so transitivity is satisfied). For example, with a 3-element set {1,2,3} partitioned into 3 classes {{1},{2},{3}}, we need exactly 3 pairs: {(1,1), (2,2), (3,3)}.",
        "b": "Incorrect! 2n pairs would be more than necessary for the minimum case. Even with reflexive pairs plus some additional symmetric pairs, we'd need fewer than 2n pairs when each class has only one element.",
        "c": "Incorrect! n² would be too many pairs. This would represent the maximum when all elements are equivalent (universal relation), not the minimum case.",

        "b": "Correct! With exactly one class of size 4, |A| = 10, and 4 classes total, the remaining 6 elements must be distributed among 3 classes. To maximize the second largest class, we should distribute as {4, 3, 2, 1}, which gives the second largest size as 3 while satisfying all constraints.",

        "c": "Incorrect! While there are 365 regular days, we must account for leap years (February 29), making 366 the upper bound.",
        "d": "Correct! Since R groups people by birth month and day: 1) Each person belongs to exactly one class (their birthday). 2) The maximum number of possible birthdays is 366 (including Feb 29). 3) Some classes might be empty if no one has that birthday."

        "c": "Correct! For 'ababab', cyclic shifts produce exactly 2 unique strings: 'ababab' and 'bababa'. This is because the string has period 2.
