        "a": "Incorrect! The relation is both reflexive and symmetric. For reflexivity, when k = 0, we have a - a = 0 × m for any a, so (a,a) ∈ R. For symmetry, if a - b = k₁m, then b - a = -k₁m, which is also a multiple of m, so (b,a) ∈ R. For example, if m = 3, then (5,2) ∈ R implies (2,5) ∈ R as 5 - 2 = 1 × 3 and 2 - 5 = -1 × 3.",
        "b": "Incorrect! The relation is both symmetric and transitive. For transitivity, if a - b = k₁m and b - c = k₂m, then a - c = (k₁ + k₂)m, which is also a multiple of m. For example, if m = 2, and (6,4) and (4,2) are in R, then (6,2) must be in R as 6 - 4 = 1 × 2 and 4 - 2 = 1 × 2 implies 6 - 2 = 2 × 2.",

        "c": "Correct! If R is reflexive and circular, it must be an equivalence relation. Here's why: 1) Reflexivity is given. 2) For symmetry: if aRb, then bRb (reflexive) and bRa (circular), so R is symmetric. 3) For transitivity: if aRb and bRc, then cRa (circular), and by symmetry aRc.

        "a": "Correct! The minimum number of ordered pairs needed is exactly n, which occurs when each element is only related to itself.

        "b": "Correct! To be an equivalence relation, R needs to be reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. Since R is already symmetric and transitive, it only needs reflexivity (every element must relate to itself).
